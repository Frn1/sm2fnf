# SM2FNF

Shitty converter I made for converting SM and SSC files to FNF Psych Engine JSON charts.
Charts with BPM changes and mines should work perfectly.

I tried implementing scroll segments too, but they might not work well... Try it anyways! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Lane mapping

### **It NEEDS to be a doubles or couples chart for it to work correctly.**

The first 4 lanes are for the player/BF. The next 4 lanes are for the CPU/opponent/dad.

## Instructions

Just download the version you need from [releases](https://github.com/Frn1/sm2fnf/releases) for your file format and drag and drop the chart on the executable.
It should create an "output" folder with the chart inside.
You can also change the output folder with the `--output` or `-o` option.
